# Who I am and where I came from

I grew up in San Jose, California. On a whim during high school, I decided to do my required volunteer hours as a teaching assistant at San Francisco Zoo. And it was great to talk to people about animals!

I went to [San Francisco State University](https://sfsu.edu/) and continued volunteering at the zoo, thinking I would be a veterinarian. I ended up doing research as an undergraduate in the [Swei Lab](https://www.sweilab.com/) studying disease ecology and being a conservation intern at the San Francisco Zoo. Both were super interesting, but I was still convinced I was going to be a veterinarian.

I moved to Washington to live with my sister once I graduated from SFSU and finally got some veterinarian experience, but it was not to my liking. So I served some pizza for awhile and then ended up at University of Washington in the [Doherty Lab](http://depts.washington.edu/joubert/). There I learned a lot about bioinformatics, but I missed thinking about conservation. So I packed it up and came to graduate school!

When I am not working I have a variety of hobbies. My top four things to do are:

1. Running,
1. Playing video games online with friends from all over,
1. Bouldering at the gym- I'm terrible but it is so fun,
1. Gardeing  

Here is a picture of me releasing a frog as a conservation intern!

# Research Interests

Climate change, conservation, and genetics are my primary research interests. As species deal with climate change- how do they change(or not) genetically? And how can we help conserve species better with this information?

## Influential papers

One of the reasons I ended up at CSU was finding @bay2018genomic which described an approach to use current genetic variation to predict population success at adapting to future climate changes. I was blown away! Here was an intersection of my research interests.

Another influential paper to how I approach climate and conservation is @thurman_persist_2020. Aside from the snappy title, it lays out the most basic responses that species can have to environmental change aside from extinction. Then the paper details a framework for assessing adaptive capacity that seems broadly relevant when thinking about conservation management.


## Mathematics behind my research

Currently, my grasp on the math behind my research is not complete. Though I took and appreciated biostatistics classes as a researcher at UW.

My favorite statistical distribution is the Poisson distribution!
$$
P(\mathrm{X}=x) = \frac{\lambda^x e^{-\lambda}}{x!}
$$

## My computing experience

My primary computing experience has included the basics of Java and Python, with a 'learned-on-the-job' bunch of shell scripting. And a bunch of using bioinformatics tools.

Here is a silly program from a course in Java that makes a cheating hangman program:
```java
// Class HangmanMain is the driver program for the Hangman program.  It reads a
// dictionary of words to be used during the game and then plays a game with
// the user.  This is a cheating version of hangman that delays picking a word
// to keep its options open.  You can change the setting for SHOW_COUNT to see
// how many options are still left on each turn.

import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;

public class HangmanMain  {
    public static final String DICTIONARY_FILE = "dictionary.txt";
    public static final boolean SHOW_COUNT = true;  // show # of choices left

    public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {
        System.out.println("Welcome to the cse143 hangman game.");
        System.out.println();

        // open the dictionary file and read dictionary into an ArrayList
        Scanner input = new Scanner(new File(DICTIONARY_FILE));
        List<String> dictionary = new ArrayList<String>();
        while (input.hasNext())
            dictionary.add(input.next().toLowerCase());

        // set basic parameters
        Scanner console = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("What length word do you want to use? ");
        int length = console.nextInt();
        System.out.print("How many wrong answers allowed? ");
        int max = console.nextInt();
        System.out.println();

        // set up the HangmanManager and start the game
        List<String> dictionary2 = Collections.unmodifiableList(dictionary);
        HangmanManager hangman = new HangmanManager2(dictionary2, length, max);
        if (hangman.words().isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println("No words of that length in the dictionary.");
        } else {
            playGame(console, hangman);
            showResults(hangman);
        }
    }

    // Plays one game with the user
    public static void playGame(Scanner console, HangmanManager hangman) {
        while (hangman.guessesLeft() > 0 && hangman.pattern().contains("-")) {
            System.out.println("guesses : " + hangman.guessesLeft());
            if (SHOW_COUNT) {
                System.out.println("words   : " + hangman.words().size());
            }
            System.out.println("guessed : " + hangman.guesses());
            System.out.println("current : " + hangman.pattern());
            System.out.print("Your guess? ");
            char ch = console.next().toLowerCase().charAt(0);
            if (hangman.guesses().contains(ch)) {
                System.out.println("You already guessed that");
            } else {
                int count = hangman.record(ch);
                if (count == 0) {
                    System.out.println("Sorry, there are no " + ch + "'s");
                    hangman.words();
                } else if (count == 1) {
                    System.out.println("Yes, there is one " + ch);
                    hangman.words();
                } else {
                    System.out.println("Yes, there are " + count + " " + ch +
                                       "'s");
                }
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }

    // reports the results of the game, including showing the answer
    public static void showResults(HangmanManager hangman) {
        // if the game is over, the answer is the first word in the list
        // of words, so we use an iterator to get it
        String answer = hangman.words().iterator().next();
        System.out.println("answer = " + answer);
        if (hangman.guessesLeft() > 0) {
            System.out.println("You beat me");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Sorry, you lose");
        }
    }
}
```

And here is a short bit of code to read a temperature and CO2 sensor attached to a raspberry pi that I was fiddling with in an attempt to monitor an incubator:

```Python
#Python app to run a K-30 Sensor
import serial
import time
ser = serial.Serial("/dev/ttyAMA0")
print "Serial Connected!"
ser.flushInput()
time.sleep(1)

while True:
    ser.write("\xFE\x44\x00\x08\x02\x9F\x25")
    time.sleep(.01)
    resp = ser.read(7)
    high = ord(resp[3])
    low = ord(resp[4])
    co2 = (high*256) + low
    print ""
    print ""
    print "Co2 = " + str(co2)
    time.sleep(1)
```

## What I hope to get out of this class

* Translate my previously learned bioinformatics skills to a new cluster operating system and new species/set of questions.
* Learn how to keep code and figures in easily reproducible bundles.
* Make some pretty figures!

# Evaluating some R code

I just like the aesthetics of this graph.


```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggridges)
library(ggplot2)
library(viridis)
library(hrbrthemes)

# Plot
ggplot(lincoln_weather, aes(x = `Mean Temperature [F]`, y = `Month`, fill = ..x..)) +
  geom_density_ridges_gradient(scale = 3, rel_min_height = 0.01) +
  scale_fill_viridis(name = "Temp. [F]", option = "C") +
  labs(title = 'Temperatures in Lincoln NE in 2016') +
  theme_ipsum() +
    theme(
      legend.position="none",
      panel.spacing = unit(0.1, "lines"),
      strip.text.x = element_text(size = 8)
    )

```
